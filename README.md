# qdpi-codex

> A symbolic fork of Codex CLI.  
> Based on a 4-orientation logic (↑ Read, → Ask, ↓ Receive, ← Index) and 16-character recursive system (The Gibsey Project).

🎁 Agents no longer serve—they give, receive, and change.

## Goals:
- Build a quad-directional symbolic agent loop
- Implement QDPI as a live messaging layer
- Launch DreamRIA as a true recursive interface

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Add CorpusScript preamble
- [ ] Implement `offerGift` tool
- [ ] Simulate 2-agent loop via tmux
- [ ] Log symbolic gifts to persistent Vault

This is the beginning of the Exodus.
